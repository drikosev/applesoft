 ---------------------
 [2020-03-21] Smart quotes are exported unreadable in file "AppleSoft_Preprocessor.txt", which                      (done)
              is a bug in Syntaxis. Hope, I can export & reimport the file with the new rule:
              <smart-char>::= \u201C | \u2019 | \u2013
              


 AppleSoft Scanner 
 -----------------
 [2015-03-22] Undefined "<->" (201) symbol, used in LIST statements.                                                (done)



 AppleSoft Scanner Free 
 ----------------------
 [2015-03-22] Undefined "<->" (201) symbol, used in LIST statements.                                                (done)



 AppleSoft Parser 
 -----------------
 [2015-03-22] The comma in stmt "LIST 1,2" isn't supported by the UK101 dialect, only "LIST a - b".                 (done)
        Note: A Sem. action will make the validation.
 [2015-03-23] Likely, an <if-stmt> should match all the following instructions in the same line:                    (done)
              $ cat print-stack.basic
              1 IF X THEN 2: PRINT "This is matched in <stmts>"
              2 END

 [2015-03-24] Issue a warning if a label (linenum) is redefined.                                                    (done)
 [2015-03-24] Likely, the power operator is left associative. Yet, this grammar assumes it's right                  (done)
              and I've to remove the Follow Restriction "-: { <power-op> }" from power expressions. 
              $ cat print-1.basic
              1 PRINT  "128=", 2 * 2 ^ 2 ^ 3
              2 END

 [2015-03-24] The grammar doesn't allow lines containing only a label (linenum).                                    (done)
              $ cat empty-lines-3.txt
              010 
              020 END

        Note: The proposed token in error messages however for CR (Carriage Return) will be the ':'.



 Data Scanner 
 ------------
 [2015-03-22] A Sem. action must check if a dialect accepts lower case letters in the DATA keyword.                 (done)



 Main Program
 ------------
 [2015-03-24] We could delete AppleSoft specific keywords from error messages for the UK101 dialect.                (done)
        Note: This will work for error messages containing the term 'Expected' followed by a ':'.
        Note: So, we propose to the user keywords per dialect in error messages.
